# Redis Clone

https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-redis

Data is stored in `data/data.rdb`. Note that this format is **not** strictly following the standard RDB format. Some changes have been made for easier implementation.

```sh
# prints the make commands
make

# be sure to install redis-cli first
redis-cli <COMMAND>
redis-cli incr k
redis-cli save
```
